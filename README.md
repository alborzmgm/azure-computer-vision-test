# Testing azure computer vision service for reading numbers in an image
In this sample I tried to read the numbers from a display that has 7 segment numbers.\
There are 3 images from the same screen but are in different format and sizes. \
You can see that for each image Azure service returns different numbers.

Add your key to the code to run.
